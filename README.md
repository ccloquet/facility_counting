# facility_counting
A quick &amp; dirty web app for real time counting the in &amp; outs in a facility, as well as the real time occupation of the different zones

- is to be used as a Google Sheet App (the Google sheet is the database)
- Sheet1 contains the current values at the appropriate places
- Log_A to Log_E log each operation (+1, -1, 0)

- quite slow but enough for the purpose
